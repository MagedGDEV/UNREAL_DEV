Let's start by getting to know how to fire up the game and start playing it in the editor.

* Click on the **play** button in the top menu bar.
* Press on the game screen to start interacting with the game.
* To stop playing the game, click on the **escape** button on the keyboard.

To move around the editor scene, we have different options:

* Hold the **left mouse** button and move the mouse to rotate the camera, this gives us a 360 view of the scene and you can move around the scene by moving the mouse.
  * This option is called **orbiting**, it won't allow you to move the camera up or down.
